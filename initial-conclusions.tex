\begin{itemize}
\item Hard aspects from the planets managing the times, especially those involving P10 and N10, appear to win out over soft aspects with the possible exception of a partile trine involving a planet in or ruling the 10th in either time
\vspace{0.5em}

\item A burnt \Mercury\, as one of the planets managing the times appears to ensure a loss
\vspace{0.5em}

\item The \SouthNode\, in N10 appears to weaken chances (see Wilkie, McGovern); in P10 it gives mixed indications: Reagan, Obama, and Biden all had it in P10 and won while George H.W. Bush had it in P10 with the ruler of P1 and lost and Dole had it in P10 with Uranus and lost but he also had a burnt \Mercury\, ruling P1 \Trine\, P10
