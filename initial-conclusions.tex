\begin{itemize}
\item Hard aspects from the planets managing the times, especially those involving P10 and N10, appear to win out over soft aspects
\item A burnt \Mercury\, as one of planets managing the times appears to ensure a loss
\item The \SouthNode\, conjunct one of the planets managing the times greatly weakens the chances of a win; especially if it is conjunct the planet ruling P10
\end{itemize}
